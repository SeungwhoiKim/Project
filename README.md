## Introduction
This is CS 4644 project for team 6. Our topic is about sustainability. There are two stages in our game, and each one must reach a different goal to clear the stage. We wanted to show the changes caused by the emergence of nature and humans by difference of difficulty of stage 1 and stage 2, and at the same time, to express how much the changes in the human environment affect the animals living in nature and what difficulties they have created in their lives.

## How To Run
Run CS4644Project.exe, which is located inside 'GamePlay' folder.
